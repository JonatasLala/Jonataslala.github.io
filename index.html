    <p> 
      Have you ever heard one's saying "We are in a mission"? The idea
      for the title name came out of an "all you can eat" sushi experine.well I love shushi and
      my friends and I where in a misson to eat as much as we could and make the manager cry.

          There is no such a great experience than living a crosscultural life. Life beomes your classroom as
            everyday is an opportunity to learn new things. You grow, strech,enlarge and better yourself. I live everyday
            to reflect Papa's glory as as I am reveald more of my identity as a Son. Uniqueness,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonataslala.d/">Afrome!</a>
